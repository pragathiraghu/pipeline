Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It helps developers manage a project’s build, dependencies, and overall project structure. Maven simplifies repetitive tasks like compiling code, packaging applications, and managing dependencies (libraries your project needs).

Key Features of Maven:
Dependency Management: Automatically downloads and resolves dependencies.
Build Automation: Handles building, testing, and packaging applications.
Consistency: Provides a standard way of building projects across teams.
Plugins: Extends its functionality for testing, deploying, and more.
Maven Life Cycle Explained
Maven operates through a Build Life Cycle, which is a sequence of phases that define the steps to build and deploy your project. The three main life cycles are:

Clean Life Cycle: Focuses on cleaning the project directory by removing files generated during previous builds.
Default Life Cycle: Handles the core build process.
Site Life Cycle: Creates documentation for the project.
Default Life Cycle Phases (Most Important)
validate: Checks if the project is correct and all necessary information is available (like pom.xml configuration).
compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
test: Runs tests using frameworks like JUnit to verify the code works as expected.
package: Packages the compiled code into a deliverable format, like a .jar or .war file.
verify: Runs checks to ensure the package meets quality standards.
install: Installs the package into the local repository (on your computer), making it available for other projects.
deploy: Uploads the final package to a remote repository for sharing with others.
Maven Life Cycle Flow Example:
Imagine you have a Java project and run:

bash
Copy code
mvn install
This triggers the Default Life Cycle, and Maven will:

Validate the project setup (validate phase).
Compile the Java files into bytecode (compile phase).
Run unit tests to ensure the code works (test phase).
Package the compiled code into a .jar file (package phase).
Install the .jar file into your local Maven repository (install phase).
If you later run:

bash
Copy code
mvn deploy
Maven will deploy the .jar to a shared remote repository.

Think of Maven as:
A helper who builds your Java project step by step, following a checklist (life cycle).
A librarian who finds and manages the books (dependencies) your project needs.
