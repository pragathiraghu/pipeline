The build process is the series of steps that take your code (the source code written by developers) and turn it into a format that a computer can run (like an executable program or a deployable application). Think of it like baking a cake: you have ingredients (code) and follow a recipe (process) to create the final product (a running application).

Simplified Steps of the Build Process
Fetch Code: Take the latest version of the source code from a repository like GitHub or GitLab.
Compile Code: If your code is written in languages like Java, C++, or C#, it needs to be converted into machine-readable code.
Example: Java code is turned into .class files.
Resolve Dependencies: Gather all the extra libraries or tools your code depends on to work properly.
Run Tests: Ensure the code works correctly by running automated tests.
Package: Combine all the compiled code, libraries, and resources into a single file or folder, like a .jar, .zip, or Docker image.
Deploy (optional): Sometimes, the build process ends with sending the package to a testing or production environment.
Example in Simple Terms:
If you are making a pizza:

Fetch ingredients: Collect dough, cheese, toppings, and sauce.
Prepare base: Flatten the dough.
Add toppings: Spread sauce, add cheese and veggies.
Bake: Cook the pizza in the oven.
Serve: Deliver the pizza to the table (or package it for takeaway).
Tools for Build Process
Maven/Gradle (for Java projects)
Make (for C/C++ projects)
Jenkins (automates the entire process)
